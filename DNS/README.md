# DNS 
Domain Name Service (DNS) is an Internet service that maps IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDN) to one another

1. Authoritative DNS Server

An authoritative name server is a server that stores DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.) for domain names. These servers will only respond to queries for locally stored DNS zone files. 

2. Recursive Nameserver
A recursive name server is a DNS server that receives queries for informational purposes (do not store DNS records). When a query is received, it will search the cache memory for an address linked to the IP address. If the recursive name server has the information, then it will return a response to query sender. If it does not have the record, then the query will be sent to other recursive name servers. This continues until it reaches an authoritative DNS server that can supply the IP address.


## DNS Zones
A DNS zone is an administrative space within the Domain Name System. A zone forms one part of the DNS namespace delegated to administrators or specific entities. Each zone contains the resource records for all of its domain names.

DNS zone file is a text file with all the records for every domain within that zone. It contains TTL for Time to Live in serverâ€™s cache memory. It displays the Start of Authority (SOA) record which shows the primary authoritative name server for the DNS Zone.

## Records 

- A record (or Address Record) points a domain name to an IP address.
- CNAME (Canonical Name) Record forwards a domain name to a different domain name. This record does not contain an IP address. 
- MX (Mail Exchanger)
- TXT (Text) Record
- NS (Name Server) Record
- SOA (Start of Authority) Record
- SRV (Service) Record
- PTR (Pointer) Record


## Inbuilt Tools 

### bind
Ubuntu used BIND (Berkley Internet Naming Daemon)9 for DNS ops and dnsutils to troubleshoot.

/etc/bind/named.conf.options: global DNS options
/etc/bind/named.conf.local: for your zones
/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones: default zones such as localhost, its reverse, and the root hints

### dig ( DNS lookup utility) :

	dig -x 127.0.0.1
	; <<>> DiG 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.17-Ubuntu <<>> -x 127.0.0.1
